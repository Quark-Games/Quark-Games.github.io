#### [Crazy Spin](https://quarkgames.itch.io/crazy-spin)

Classic pong game?

**No!**

There is *more* than that.

A giant creature living in the jungle might pop up and steal your pong. Floating asteroids in endless space might drag your pong to mysterious curves...

Above all, the ball turns **madly** in this game.
